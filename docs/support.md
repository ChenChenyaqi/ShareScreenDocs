# LocalScreen Support

Thank you for using LocalScreen.

LocalScreen is a real-time screen sharing app designed for nearby devices on a local network. It focuses on low-latency sharing without requiring a cloud account or internet-based relay service.

If you need help or want to send feedback, please contact:

- Support email: `localscreen423@163.com`

## What we can help with

You can contact support for issues such as:

- Nearby devices are not discovered
- Screen sharing cannot be started
- Connection fails after entering the session code
- Local Network or Camera permission issues
- Crashes, lag, black screen, or streaming delay
- Suggestions about usability, localization, or compatibility

## Helpful information to include

To help diagnose the issue faster, include:

- Device model
- iOS version
- App version
- Steps to reproduce
- Whether Local Network permission, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are enabled

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Why can't I find nearby devices?

Make sure both devices have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, and that LocalScreen has permission to access the local network.

### 2. Why can't the viewer see the screen after sharing starts?

Make sure the host selected LocalScreen in the iOS screen broadcast picker and successfully started the broadcast session.

### 3. Does LocalScreen send my screen content over the internet?

No. Based on the current product design, LocalScreen is primarily intended for device-to-device transfer on a local network and does not rely on a developer-operated cloud relay service.

### 4. Where can I read the privacy policy?
