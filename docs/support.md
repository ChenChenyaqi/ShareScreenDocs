# LocalScreen Support for iPhone and iPad Screen Sharing

- Local Network or Camera permission issues
- Crashes, lag, black screen, or local screen sharing delay

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Why can't I find nearby devices?

Make sure both devices have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, and that LocalScreen has permission to access the local network.

### 2. Why can't the viewer see the screen after sharing starts?

Make sure the host selected LocalScreen in the iOS screen broadcast picker and successfully started the broadcast session for iPhone or iPad screen sharing.

### 3. Does LocalScreen send my screen content over the internet?

No. Based on the current product design, LocalScreen is primarily intended for iOS local screen sharing between nearby devices on a local network and does not rely on a developer-operated cloud relay service.
