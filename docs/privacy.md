# LocalScreen Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-28

LocalScreen respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use LocalScreen and its related features.

## 1. Who we are

LocalScreen is currently provided and maintained by an independent developer.
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact: `localscreen423@163.com`

## 2. Information we handle

Based on the current version of the app, LocalScreen does not require account registration and does not actively collect personal identity information such as your name, phone number, email address, contacts, or precise location through a developer-operated server.

While you use the app, the following information may be processed locally on your device or during local network connections:

- Device name, used to display and identify nearby devices
- Screen content generated during sharing, used for real-time transmission between devices you authorize
- Connection status data, such as whether sharing is active, whether a connection succeeds, and whether a session code is validated
- Images you voluntarily choose for QR code recognition, processed locally on your device

## 3. Permissions

LocalScreen may request the following system permissions:

### Local Network

Used to discover and connect to nearby devices for local screen sharing.

### Camera

Used to scan QR codes for faster session connection.

### Photo Picker

You may voluntarily choose an image from your photo library to recognize a QR code. This action is initiated by you.

## 4. How data is transmitted

Based on the current implementation, LocalScreen primarily transfers screen content between nearby devices over a local network.
We do not currently provide a developer-operated cloud server to relay your screen content or session data.

## 5. What we do not do

Based on the current version of the app, we do not:

- Require you to create an account or sign in
- Store your screen content on a developer-operated server
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use personal identity data for ad profiling unless this policy is updated to state otherwise

## 6. Third-party services

Based on the current codebase, we do not currently identify third-party SDKs for advertising, behavioral analytics, or cloud account management.

If new third-party services are added in the future and change how data is handled, this Privacy Policy will be updated.

## 7. Data retention

LocalScreen is primarily designed for real-time connection and transmission. Except for necessary caching that may be performed by the operating system, device, or platform itself, we do not currently retain your screen sharing content or account data on a developer-operated server.

## 8. Children's privacy

LocalScreen is not specifically directed to children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a minor has provided information that should not have been provided, please contact us by email.

## 9. Your choices

You can control data handling by:

- Disabling Local Network or Camera permission in iOS Settings
- Stopping screen sharing
- Uninstalling the app
- Contacting us about privacy-related concerns

## 10. Policy changes

We may update this Privacy Policy when features, compliance requirements, or data handling practices change. The updated version will be published on this page with a new effective date.
